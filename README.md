# Handwriting-Recognition
The GitHub Repository for the Recognition &amp; Conversion of Handwritten Text into Digital Words.

## Project Description
This repository accurately converts handwritten text into digital words. Using image processing and computer vision techniques, the tool will leverage machine learning to recognize and interpret various handwriting styles, ensuring high accuracy and efficient text processing.

## Project Structure:
The flowchart for the project is as follows:

The directory structure meanwhile is:

## Build Instructions
To detect letters, run:
```bash
python3 run_predictor.py EMNIST
```
To detect digits, run:
```bash
python3 run_predictor.py MNIST
```
